# HistoGPT

HistoGPT is a vision language foundation model for dermatopathology. The model takes multiple tissue sections from a patient as input and generates highly accurate pathology reports that include the disease classification, tumor subtype prediction, tumor thickness estimation, and other important information. Most importantly, the model is fully interpretable, as every word in the output text can be visualized in the original input image.
