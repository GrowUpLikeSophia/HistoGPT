# HistoGPT

HistoGPT is a vision language foundation model for dermatopathology. The model takes multiple tissue sections from a patient as input and generates highly accurate pathology reports that include the disease classification, tumor subtype prediction, tumor thickness estimation, and other important information. Most importantly, the model is fully interpretable, as every word in the output text can be visualized in the original input image.

We trained HistoGPT on a large dataset of 6,000 patient-report pairs from over 12,000 whole slide images (WSIs) of over 150 different skin conditions provided by the Department of Dermatology at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). We extensively evaluated the model on five external cohorts from five different countries, including a dataset of 1,300 patient-report pairs from the University Hospital Muenster (UKM).
